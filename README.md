Interactive Media Scenario Information (10/100),

For our scenario we are building foundations for our GDW project made 
in Unity. The game is a horror-themed first-person shooter rogue-lite 
game where up to 3 players battle against another player-controlled 
monster over a set of procedurally generated floors. In our game, we 
plan to have asymmetric online multiplayer, proximity voice chat, 
weapons, resource collection, procedurally generated floors, 
tasks/puzzles, crafting, cosmetics, and monster mutations. We decided 
directly before the reading week that we would be switching to Unity, 
rather than continuing with Unreal, so we’ve lost a lot of time and 
have had to catch up. As a result, we’ve had to sacrifice visuals in 
favor of implementing game foundations due to time constraints.
