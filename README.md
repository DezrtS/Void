Interactive Media Scenario Information (10/100),

For our scenario we are building foundations for our GDW project made 
in Unity. The game is a horror-themed first-person shooter rogue-lite 
game where up to 3 players battle against another player-controlled 
monster over a set of procedurally generated floors. In our game, we 
plan to have asymmetric online multiplayer, proximity voice chat, 
weapons, resource collection, procedurally generated floors, 
tasks/puzzles, crafting, cosmetics, and monster mutations. We decided 
directly before the reading week that we would be switching to Unity, 
rather than continuing with Unreal, so we’ve lost a lot of time and 
have had to catch up. As a result, we’ve had to sacrifice visuals in 
favor of implementing game foundations due to time constraints. 
Furthermore we had to revisit our project management plan to better 
cater it to unity and work as efficiently as possible. We decided to 
handle the biggest bulls first being procedural generation and online
networking and now we are currently implementing the remaining tasks as
a team with each member doing their respective role. The team of 3 players
will need to work together solving puzzles and completing tasks in game to
progress through the levels, as they go deeper enemies will be stronger and 
more frequent. The monster player's job is to sabotage and kill players 
before they are able to reach the final floor, they will have mutations 
they can pick from each floor to help them power up. Our game is expected to 
have lots of replayability due to the random level layout each time as well 
as the different mutations the monster can pick from, this makes the game 
replayable for both character-players and the monster-player. Our game will 
also include craftables for the players that they can use to help in their 
fight against the monster, things such as grenades, mines, traps and even 
special void weapons. We have been able to create foundational systems for 
the game, using the required patterns, we have used the singleton to create 
managers, like an audio manager, we have used the command pattern to make sending 
requests simpler and separate, like with the character customizer, we 
have used the observer pattern to notify key subscribers, like with the 
UI Updater, and we have used the factory pattern to create important and 
unique objects, as seen in the Enemy Creation. Many more implementations 
have been created to help set the foundations that we will use for
our game, so stay tuned to see more!
